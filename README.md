## TODO
<details>
  <summary>Already done</summary>

- ~~Add Batch download Youtube~~
- ~~Allow user to specify download path~~
- ~~Change to id based storage~~
- ~~Create a DataHandler to handle all those playlist and stuffs~~
- ~~Fetch album data from Spotify and show it~~
- ~~Allow to add a Spotify playlist~~
- ~~Allow to add a Youtube video and playlist (I don't use YT playlist much so this gonna be put off :D)~~

- ~~Show tracks separated by playlist~~ (And sorted by A-Z)
- ~~Batch get url skip songs that already have url~~
- ~~Store mp3 path info of songs~~
- ~~Validate downloaded info~~ (When hit Refresh) (Investigate missing downloads too - Probably overlapping song names)
- ~~Auto change mp3 metadata with supplied info~~ (When download, click "Save" or do Batch write metadata. Batch download 
not gonna write metadata. Write batch metadata manually)
- ~~Limit QThreadpool to something more reasonable so that 
Chrome webdriver not gonna murder someone machine~~ (Make a setting menu to set this too. Also 6 threads seems resonable)
- ~~Show album image~~ ~~(Rework showing logic: Prioritize embeded image)~~
- ~~Allow user to add album image~~
- ~~Delete button should delete downloaded track~~\
- ~~Allow user to add a mp3 file as download-path for songs~~
- ~~Add a button to choose download path~~
- ~~Allow user to choose whether to skip downloaded when doing batch download (Maybe get url too)~~ (Available in setting menu)
- ~~Allow user to add an mp3 file~~
- ~~Do import json~~ (Just copy-paste every json file in folder)
- ~~Add a settings menu~~
- ~~Change popups to actually look decent~~
- ~~Download video from Youtube now include thumbnails~~
</details>

- PARTIALLY REWRITE THE APP CAUSE I MADE AN UNMAINTAINABLE SPAGHETTI
  - ~~Use MVP architecture~~ (I hope I got it right lol)
  - ~~Refactored Import Spotify popup~~
  - ~~Move to SQLite DB instead of json~~
  - MusicListView (formerly known as SideMediaList) refactor in progress (Update the UI in the
process too)
    - Add a search bar
    - Use collapsible playlists to categorize songs
    - Add options to show songs by playlists or album or by name
  - ~~Rework ThreadWorker~~
  - ~~Rework Database~~
  - ~~Standardize a lot of stuffs~~
  - Rethink how to do cache. The current implementation is temporary to avoid getting blocked by Spotify
  - Implement a mediator to talk between presenters (Not sure if it's a good idea, but it's clean)


- Allow importing a standalone audio file
- Add soundcloud ??
- Add Apple Music import through HTML (Cause I ain't paying 99$/year unless someone fund me)
- Add a plugin system
- Use logger
- Use localization in entire app
- More features will be added later when I feel like it :D

## Issues tracker
<details>
  <summary>Fixed</summary>

- ~~Flickering popups~~ (Turns out you don't init QWidget many times. And don't restate UI elements many time. 
Just handle dynamic stuffs in a seperate function. Somehow only affected Download and Search)
- ~~Image chooser keep reopen~~ (Do not write .connect() in somewhere that run multiple time)
- ~~Song with same name will overlap when download~~ (File name now come with artist)
- ~~Delete button (Also other buttons too but less obvious) firing n times when used n times~~ (Again, do not write
.connect() somewhere it will be called multiple times)
- ~~DataManager may take 2 update first time to generate working data.json~~
- ~~QObject unexpectedly get garbage collected~~ (QObject needs a parent to not get GC.
Remember kids, QObject not QOrphan)
</details>

- Write metadata is blocking GUI
- Batch get url may not close automatically
- A few things will crash randomly cause I can't squash all bugs (TODO: Add a logging system)
- Sometimes batch operations will fail with no apparent cause (More threads more fails, just retry or lower thread count in settings)
- Will add when remember
